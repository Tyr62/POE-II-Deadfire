POE-II-Deadfire
To use mods, you must install Patchwork Launcher on Nexus (https://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity2/mods/231). Put the file named PoE2Mods.pw.dll in the Patchwork Mods directory.

If you do not want to install Patchwork, I have provided in the release the Assembly-CSharp.dll file containing:

The management of the group for 6 characters
The pets for all the companions.
You have to make a backup of the Assembly-CSharp.dll dll file in "Pillars of Eternity II\PillarsOfEternityII_Data\Managed" (rename the Assembly-CSharp.dll.bck for example) and then copy paste the new download.

There are some glyche at the interface level when selecting the members of the group as well as when spawn in an area (I have circumvented the problem by spawning the characters on the position 0 (= main character). This is no problem if you play Turn based mode, but if you play in RTwP mode the collision of the characters is buggy if a fight starts directly after the spawn (for example in the tower at Hasongo)

If you want to see or modify the mod code, you have access to the sources (containing the Obsidian public dll files).
